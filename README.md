# Credit Default Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting based on personal and financial attributes. It features a user-facing web form and a backend inference pipeline deployed on Google Cloud. The frontend is hosted using GitHub Pages.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default.
- **Interface**: A web form where users can input loan and personal details.
- **Backend**: A Flask server processes input and feeds it to a trained model.
- **Deployment**:
  - Backend hosted on Google Cloud
  - Frontend (HTML form) hosted with GitHub Pages

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes the following attributes:

| Status          | Loan status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current)               |
| Percent_Income  | Loan amount as a percentage of income                        |
| Default         | Whether the applicant previously defaulted (Yes, No)         |
